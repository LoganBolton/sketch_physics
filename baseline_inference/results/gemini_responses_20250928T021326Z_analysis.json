These lines are generally angled downwards and to the right. As the ball rolls over these lines, it will be deflected, gaining horizontal velocity to the right.\n3.  **Deflection to the Right:** The arrangement of the lines in the left cluster acts like a ramp, guiding the ball from its initial central-left position towards the right side of the screen.\n4.  **Interaction with Right Steep Line:** After clearing the left cluster, the ball, now moving downwards and to the right, will encounter the long, steep black line on the right side of the image. This line is angled sharply downwards and to the left.\n5.  **Deflection to the Left:** The ball will roll down this steep right-side line, gaining significant horizontal velocity to the left.\n6.  **Final Trajectory:** The bottom end of this steep right-side line is positioned horizontally above the right side of bucket 2, or possibly the very left side of bucket 3.

The ball will roll along this line, gaining horizontal velocity to the right.\n3.  **Second line:** After rolling off the first line, the ball will fall and hit the second black line. This line is also angled downwards to the right and is longer than the first. The ball will continue to roll to the right, further increasing its rightward horizontal velocity. The intersecting segment on this line is thin and unlikely to significantly alter the dominant rightward trajectory.\n4.  **Third line:** The ball will then fall off the second line and hit the third black line, which is parallel to the second and also angled downwards to the right. The ball will roll along this line, moving even further to the right.\n\nBy the time the ball leaves the third line, it will have accumulated substantial rightward horizontal velocity and will be positioned very far to the right in the image.\n\nLet's estimate the horizontal position:\n*   The ball starts far left.\n*   The first line moves it to roughly 30% of the image width.\n*   The second line moves it to roughly 70% of the image width.\n*   The third line moves it to roughly 90% of the image width (near the right edge).\n\nThe four buckets are positioned at the bottom of the screen, from left to right: Bucket 1, Bucket 2, Bucket 3, Bucket 4.\nBucket 4 is the rightmost bucket, covering approximately the last 15-20% of the screen width.\n\nWhen the ball leaves the third line, its horizontal position is estimated to be around x=620 (where the total width is roughly 640 pixels). The right wall of the simulation area is at x=630. The opening for Bucket 4 is roughly from x=500 to x=630.\n\nGiven that the ball is at x=620 and has a significant rightward velocity, it will almost certainly hit the right wall at x=630. The problem states that \"the bouncing of the ball is relatively minor\". This means it won't bounce wildly or lose all its rightward momentum. A minor bounce off the right wall will deflect the ball slightly to the left. This deflection will bring it back over the opening of Bucket 4.\n\nTherefore, the ball will hit the right wall, bounce slightly left, and then fall into Bucket 4.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$",
