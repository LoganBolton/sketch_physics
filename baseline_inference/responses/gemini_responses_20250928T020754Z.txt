prompt: You are given the start frame of a sketch physics puzzle. Buckets are arranged along the bottom from left to right. Predict which bucket will eventually catch the ball. Respond with JSON containing keys 'bucket_prediction' (1-indexed integer as a string) and 'rationale' explaining your reasoning.

response_text:
The ball starts at the top-center of the image. It will fall due to gravity.

1.  **Initial Fall**: The ball will fall straight down from its starting position.
2.  **Interaction with Left Obstacles**: The ball will first encounter the cluster of black lines on the left side of the screen. Given the ball's horizontal starting position, it will likely hit the line that slopes downwards and to the right within this cluster. This interaction will impart some horizontal velocity to the right.
3.  **Interaction with Right Obstacle**: After being directed to the right, the ball will continue to fall. Its trajectory will lead it to collide with the long, steep diagonal black line on the right side of the screen. This line slopes significantly downwards and to the right.
4.  **Final Trajectory**: Hitting this steep diagonal line will direct the ball strongly towards the bottom-right corner of the screen. Following this line, the ball will be guided past buckets 1, 2, and 3.
5.  **Prediction**: The combined effect of the initial interaction pushing it right and the final, strong redirection by the long diagonal line will cause the ball to land in Bucket 4.

The overall setup acts like a funnel, guiding the ball from the center towards the far right.

  "rationale": "The blue ball falls from the top. It first interacts with the cluster of black lines on the left, which directs it towards the right. Subsequently, it hits the long, steep diagonal line on the right side of the image. This line is angled significantly downwards and to the right, providing a strong redirection towards the far right. Following this trajectory, the ball will bypass buckets 1, 2, and 3, ultimately landing in bucket 4."
